# Auto-Author Project Handoff Document

## Current Development State (December 2024)

### Project Overview
Auto-Author is a full-stack web application for AI-assisted book writing. Authors can create books, generate table of contents, answer AI-generated questions, and receive draft content suggestions. The system features a rich text editor, voice input, and export capabilities.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Clerk Auth, TipTap Editor
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python 3.11+, MongoDB, OpenAI API
- **Infrastructure**: Docker-ready, supports both local and cloud deployment
- **Testing**: Jest (frontend), Pytest (backend), Playwright (E2E)

## Recent Development Progress

### What Was Just Completed
1. **Backend Test Suite Fixed (100% passing)**
   - Fixed all `Request.scope.get()` errors in API endpoints
   - Added missing schema fields (`book_id` to Question models)
   - Resolved import conflicts (ChapterMetadataCache vs ChapterCacheService)
   - Fixed database connection handling in migration scripts
   - Added comprehensive E2E test suite validating entire workflow

2. **Frontend Test Coverage Improved (92.4% passing)**
   - Fixed 55 out of 59 failing tests
   - Remaining 4 tests in BookList.test.tsx need attention
   - All critical path tests are passing

3. **Production-Ready Features**
   - Rich text editor with full formatting capabilities
   - AI draft generation with multiple writing styles
   - Voice input using Browser Speech API
   - PDF/DOCX export with customizable options
   - Auto-save with 3-second debounce
   - Character count and save status indicators

## Current Sprint Status (Sprint 3-4: Production Ready)

### Completed âœ…
- Voice input integration
- Export functionality (PDF/DOCX)
- Complete backend test coverage
- E2E test infrastructure
- Mock service replacements for production

### In Progress ðŸš§
1. **Export UI Enhancement** - Add prominent Export button on book detail page
2. **Production Deployment** - Set up infrastructure and CI/CD
3. **Security Hardening** - Conduct security audit and implement fixes
4. **Performance Optimization** - Bundle size and query optimization

## Next Steps for Development

### Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Fix Export Button Visibility**
   - Add prominent export button to book detail page
   - Currently hidden in menu, users can't find it
   - See `frontend/src/components/BookDetail.tsx`

2. **Production Infrastructure**
   - Set up Docker containers
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Database backups and monitoring

3. **Security Audit**
   - Review authentication flows
   - Implement rate limiting on all expensive endpoints
   - Add input validation on all user inputs
   - Review and fix any exposed secrets

### Known Issues to Address
1. **Frontend**: 4 tests failing in `BookList.test.tsx`
2. **Backend**: Test suite times out in some environments (works locally)
3. **UX**: Export functionality not discoverable
4. **Performance**: Large books (>50 chapters) show performance degradation

## Key Files and Locations

### Configuration
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Environment configuration
- `frontend/.env.local` - Frontend environment variables
- `backend/.env` - Backend environment variables

### Critical Components
- `backend/app/api/endpoints/books.py` - Main API endpoints
- `backend/app/services/ai_service.py` - AI integration
- `frontend/src/components/BookDetail.tsx` - Main authoring interface
- `frontend/src/components/RichTextEditor.tsx` - TipTap editor wrapper

### Test Files
- `backend/tests/test_system_e2e.py` - Complete E2E workflow test
- `frontend/src/__tests__/BookList.test.tsx` - Needs fixing
- `backend/quick_validate.py` - Quick validation script

## Environment Setup for New Developer

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Clerk keys
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Backend (all should pass)
cd backend
uv run pytest

# Frontend (92.4% pass rate)
cd frontend
npm test

# E2E tests
cd backend
uv run pytest tests/test_system_e2e.py -v
```

## API Keys and Services Required
1. **OpenAI API Key** - For AI features
2. **Clerk API Keys** - For authentication
3. **MongoDB Connection** - Database
4. **AWS Credentials** (optional) - For S3 storage and Transcribe
5. **Cloudinary** (optional) - For image storage

## Architecture Decisions

### Why These Choices
- **FastAPI**: Async support, automatic API documentation
- **MongoDB**: Flexible schema for evolving book structures
- **TipTap**: Most flexible rich text editor for books
- **Clerk**: Production-ready auth with minimal setup
- **uv**: Fast Python package management

### Trade-offs Made
- Chose simplicity over complexity for MVP
- Local file storage with cloud fallback (vs cloud-only)
- Browser Speech API over cloud transcription (cost/simplicity)
- Monorepo structure for easier development

- Documentation: See `/docs` folder
- Implementation Plan: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Development Guidelines: `CLAUDE.md`

## Final Notes
The project is at a critical juncture - the MVP is complete and functional, but needs production hardening. The test suite is now solid, providing confidence for future changes. The main focus should be on deployment, security, and UX improvements before adding new features.

All core features are working:
- Authors can create and manage books
- AI assists with content generation
- Rich text editing with auto-save
- Voice input for accessibility
- Export to standard formats

The codebase is well-structured and tested, ready for the next phase of development.
