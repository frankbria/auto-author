# FEATURE COMPLETION SUMMARY

## Vertical Chapter Tabs Implementation (Completed May 27, 2025)

**Feature Description:** Changed chapter tabs system from horizontal to vertical orientation for better screen space utilization and improved user experience.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/chapters/ChapterTabs.tsx` - Added orientation prop, updated layout for vertical mode
- `frontend/src/components/chapters/TabBar.tsx` - Implemented vertical sidebar layout with conditional styling  
- `frontend/src/components/chapters/ChapterTab.tsx` - Updated styling for both horizontal and vertical orientations
- `todo.md` - Updated task completion status

**Key Changes:**
1. **Interface Updates**: Added `orientation?: 'horizontal' | 'vertical'` prop to component interfaces
2. **Layout Structure**: Modified main container to use flex layout for vertical orientation
3. **Conditional Styling**: Implemented different styles for horizontal vs vertical modes
4. **Drag-and-Drop**: Updated drag direction from "horizontal" to "vertical" for vertical mode
5. **Sidebar Design**: Added vertical sidebar styling (w-64, border-r, flex-col)
6. **Default Orientation**: Set vertical as the default orientation
7. **Tab Styling**: Updated individual tab styling to work in both orientations
8. **Space Optimization**: Removed title truncation in vertical mode for better readability

**Result:** Chapter tabs now display as a vertical sidebar on the left, providing better space utilization and a more familiar navigation pattern similar to VS Code or other IDEs.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Feature is fully implemented and tested
