- ✅ Empty state after deleting last book
- ✅ Compatibility with book creation
- ✅ Network error handling

## Running the Tests

To run all the new tests:

```bash
# Run all new tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="BookCard|BookDetailPDFExport|ExportPage|DashboardBookDelete"

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="BookCard|BookDetailPDFExport|ExportPage|DashboardBookDelete" --coverage

# Run individual test suites
npm test -- --testPathPattern="BookCard.test"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="BookDetailPDFExport.test"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="ExportPage.test"
npm test -- --testPathPattern="DashboardBookDelete.test"
```

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 4
- **Total Test Suites**: 15
- **Total Individual Tests**: ~80+
- **Lines of Test Code**: ~1,500+

## Key Testing Patterns Used

1. **Mocking**: Comprehensive mocking of external dependencies (Clerk, API client, router, toast)
2. **Async Testing**: Proper handling of async operations with `waitFor`
3. **User Interaction**: Testing user flows with `fireEvent`
4. **Error Scenarios**: Testing both success and failure paths
5. **Edge Cases**: Handling empty states, network errors, and data variations
6. **State Management**: Verifying UI updates after operations

## Coverage Areas

All critical paths for the three features are covered:
- Happy paths (successful operations)
- Error paths (API failures, network errors)
- Edge cases (empty data, missing fields)
- User interactions (clicks, form inputs)
- Loading states
- Navigation flows

These tests ensure the robustness and reliability of the newly implemented features.
