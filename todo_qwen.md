# Auto Author - Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive development plan for the Auto Author project based on the next recommended steps. The plan focuses on improving the application's stability, user experience, test coverage, and performance.

## Current Status
✅ Application is fully functional with all critical issues resolved
✅ Authentication system working with Clerk integration
✅ API endpoints responding successfully
✅ Frontend and backend ready for production deployment
✅ Test coverage significantly improved (70.33% for bookClient.ts)

## Development Priorities
1. Testing and Quality Assurance
2. User Experience Improvements
3. Performance Optimization
4. Accessibility Enhancements
5. Developer Experience

## Phase 1: Testing and Quality Assurance

### 1.1 Fix State Management Issues
- [ ] Fix auto-save race conditions in `ChapterEditor`
- [ ] Add mutex/lock for save operations
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup for Speech Recognition in `VoiceTextInput`
- [ ] Add AbortController for all API calls
- [ ] Fix tab state synchronization conflicts

### 1.2 Test Infrastructure Improvements
- [ ] Fix React act() warnings in tests
- [ ] Update outdated mocks to match current APIs
- [ ] Create test utilities for common patterns
- [ ] Add jest coverage thresholds (80% minimum)
- [ ] Fix remaining TypeScript errors in test files (36+ non-blocking)

### 1.3 Increase Test Coverage
- [ ] Add tests for `useChapterTabs.ts` (currently 43.58% coverage)
- [ ] Add tests for `BookCreationWizard`
- [ ] Add tests for `ChapterEditor`
- [ ] Add tests for all Tab components
- [ ] Create E2E tests for core workflows (book creation → editing → export)

## Phase 2: User Experience Improvements

### 2.1 Responsive Design Fixes
- [ ] Replace fixed widths with responsive classes (BookCard, dialogs)
- [ ] Add intermediate breakpoints (sm:) to all layouts
- [ ] Increase touch targets to 44x44px minimum
- [ ] Fix form layouts for mobile
- [ ] Add responsive text sizing
- [ ] Fix toolbar overflow on mobile

### 2.2 Accessibility Enhancements
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation to `BookCard`
- [ ] Add ARIA labels to all toolbar buttons
- [ ] Implement focus trapping in modals
- [ ] Add skip navigation links
- [ ] Fix form labels for all inputs
- [ ] Add screen reader announcements for errors

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization

### 3.1 Code and Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Add code splitting for large components
- [ ] Implement list virtualization for long chapter lists
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (analyze and reduce)
- [ ] Add memoization for expensive operations
- [ ] Optimize auto-save frequency (current 3s may be too frequent)

### 3.2 Memory Management
- [ ] Clean up all event listeners properly
- [ ] Clear all timers on unmount
- [ ] Fix refs that aren't cleaned up
- [ ] Add proper cleanup for subscriptions

## Phase 4: Error Handling and Resilience

### 4.1 Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed requests
- [ ] Add offline support detection
- [ ] Create error recovery mechanisms

## Phase 5: Developer Experience

### 5.1 Development Tooling
- [ ] Add Prettier configuration
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks with Husky
- [ ] Create component documentation
- [ ] Add Storybook for component development
- [ ] Set up visual regression testing

## Testing Plan

### Core User Workflows to Test
1. Book creation flow
2. Summary input and TOC generation
3. Chapter editing with tab interface
4. Content generation from Q&A
5. Export functionality (PDF, DOCX, EPUB)
6. User profile management
7. Authentication flows (login, logout, registration)

### Testing Environments
- Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile devices (iOS, Android)
- Tablet devices
- Various screen sizes and resolutions

## Timeline and Milestones

### Week 1-2: Testing and Stability
- Complete state management fixes
- Fix React act() warnings
- Improve test coverage to 75%

### Week 3-4: UX Improvements
- Implement responsive design fixes
- Add accessibility enhancements
- Complete core E2E tests

### Week 5-6: Performance Optimization
- Implement code splitting and memoization
- Optimize bundle size
- Fix memory leaks

### Week 7-8: Polish and Documentation
- Complete developer tooling setup
- Final testing and bug fixes
- Documentation updates

## Success Metrics
1. Test coverage ≥ 80%
2. No React act() warnings in test output
3. All core user workflows functioning on mobile and desktop
4. Page load time ≤ 2 seconds
5. Bundle size reduced by 20%
6. Accessibility score ≥ 95 on Lighthouse
7. Zero critical or high-priority issues in TODO

## Risk Mitigation
1. Regular code reviews to maintain quality
2. Continuous integration with automated testing
3. Performance monitoring during optimization
4. Backup of current working version before major changes
5. Incremental deployment of features with rollback capability

## Resources Needed
1. Development team (1-2 developers)
2. Testing devices (multiple browsers, mobile devices)
3. Performance profiling tools
4. Accessibility testing tools (axe, Lighthouse)
5. CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## Conclusion
This development plan focuses on transforming Auto Author from a functional prototype to a production-ready application. By addressing testing, user experience, performance, and developer experience in a structured approach, we can ensure a high-quality product that meets user needs and is maintainable for future development.
