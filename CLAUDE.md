# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION & FILE MANAGEMENT

**ABSOLUTE RULES**:
1. ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message
2. **NEVER save working files, text/mds and tests to the root folder**
3. ALWAYS organize files in appropriate subdirectories

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**MANDATORY PATTERNS:**
- **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
- **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
- **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
- **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
- **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### 📁 File Organization Rules

**NEVER save to root folder. Use these directories:**
- `/src` - Source code files
- `/tests` - Test files
- `/docs` - Documentation and markdown files
- `/config` - Configuration files
- `/scripts` - Utility scripts
- `/examples` - Example code

## Recent Changes

The detailed per-issue changelog lives in [`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](docs/CHANGELOG.md) — read it when you need history on a specific issue/PR. When completing work, append the new entry **there**, not here.

Latest state (2026-07-24): P0/P1 launch-review items through #336 complete (ToS/Privacy pages, Sentry error tracking, real `/health` dependency checks, loud password-reset failure, chapter-question status filter applied before pagination). CI gates green and enforced; merge via PR with no `--admin`/`--no-verify`.

## Project Overview

This project uses SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology with Claude-Flow orchestration for systematic Test-Driven Development.

## Quick Start Commands

### SPARC Commands
- `npx claude-flow sparc modes` - List available modes
- `npx claude-flow sparc run <mode> "<task>"` - Execute specific mode
- `npx claude-flow sparc tdd "<feature>"` - Run complete TDD workflow

### Task Management (bd/Beads)
- `bd ready` - View unblocked tasks ready to start
- `bd list --status open` - View all open tasks
- `bd create "Task" -p 0 -t feature -d "Description"` - Create task
- `bd close <task-id> --reason "Completed"` - Close completed task

### Build & Test
- `npm run build` - Build project
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `npm run lint` - Linting
- `npm run typecheck` - Type checking

### Backend Testing
Test/load tooling is in optional extras (`[project.optional-dependencies]`), so
production installs stay lean. Install the `test` extra once before running:
```bash
cd backend
uv sync --extra test    # one-time: installs pytest, faker, httpx, coverage…
uv run pytest --cov=app tests/ --cov-report=term-missing
```

### E2E Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test --ui    # Run with UI mode (recommended)

# With auth bypass (for testing without real auth)
# Playwright's webServer config sets E2E_ALLOW_BYPASS=1 automatically;
# since #272 it is required alongside BYPASS_AUTH in every environment.
BYPASS_AUTH=true npx playwright test
```

#### Staging E2E (real auth against https://dev.autoauthor.app)
```bash
cd frontend
cp tests/e2e/staging/.env.test.example tests/e2e/staging/.env.test  # set STAGING_TEST_EMAIL / STAGING_TEST_PASSWORD
npm run test:e2e:staging
```
- Specs: `tests/e2e/staging/complete-user-journey.spec.ts` (full journey) and `regressions.spec.ts` (Issue #83 regressions: session/401, ObjectId, #54 answer persistence).
- CI: `.github/workflows/e2e-staging-tests.yml` runs on a 6h schedule, manual dispatch, and PRs labeled `e2e-staging`. Requires GitHub Secrets `TEST_USER_EMAIL` / `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` (the fixture also accepts `STAGING_TEST_EMAIL` / `STAGING_TEST_PASSWORD` locally).
- See `tests/e2e/staging/README.md` for details.

---

## Code Style & Best Practices

- **Modular Design**: Files under 500 lines
- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets
- **Test-First**: Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns
- **Documentation**: Keep synchronized with code

---

## 🔒 MANDATORY: TDD & E2E Test Enforcement

**CRITICAL**: This project REQUIRES Test-Driven Development and E2E test coverage for ALL features. No feature is complete without proper test coverage.

### Pre-Commit Hook Requirements

**ALL commits MUST pass these gates:**

1. **Unit Tests**: All unit tests must pass
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm test

   # Backend
   cd backend && uv run pytest tests/
   ```

2. **E2E Tests**: All E2E tests must pass
   ```bash
   # Basic E2E tests
   cd frontend && npx playwright test

   # Deployment test suite (comprehensive)
   cd frontend && npx playwright test --config=tests/e2e/deployment/playwright.config.ts
   ```

3. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 85% coverage required
   ```bash
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm test -- --coverage --coverageThreshold='{"global":{"lines":85}}'

   # Backend
   cd backend && uv run pytest --cov=app tests/ --cov-fail-under=85
   ```

4. **Linting & Type Checking**: No errors allowed
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run lint && npm run typecheck
   cd backend && uv run mypy app/
   ```

### Feature Branch Workflow (MANDATORY)

**NEVER commit directly to `main` or `develop`. Always use feature branches:**

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes and commit (pre-commit hooks will run automatically)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement your feature"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create Pull Request for review
# PR must have:
# - All tests passing
# - ≥85% test coverage
# - E2E test for user-facing features
# - Updated documentation
```

### Feature Completion Checklist (ENFORCED)

**A feature is NOT complete until ALL of these are done:**

- [ ] **Unit tests written** (≥85% coverage for new code)
- [ ] **E2E test created** (for user-facing features)
- [ ] **All tests passing** (unit + E2E)
- [ ] **Documentation updated** (CLAUDE.md, API docs, user guides)
- [ ] **Performance validated** (meets operation budgets)
- [ ] **Accessibility verified** (WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum)
- [ ] **Code reviewed** (PR approved by team)
- [ ] **bd task closed** (`bd close <task-id> --reason "Completed in PR #123"`)

### E2E Test Coverage Requirements

**EVERY user-facing feature MUST have an E2E test that validates:**

1. **Happy Path**: Complete user journey from start to finish
2. **Error Handling**: How the system handles failures
3. **Performance**: Operation completes within budget
4. **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation works
5. **Data Integrity**: Data persists correctly

**Example - TOC Generation Feature:**
```typescript
// frontend/tests/e2e/toc-generation.spec.ts
test('user can generate TOC from book summary', async ({ page }) => {
  // 1. Create book with summary
  // 2. Navigate to TOC wizard
  // 3. Answer clarifying questions
  // 4. Verify TOC generates within 3000ms budget
  // 5. Verify TOC data saves to database
  // 6. Verify TOC appears in book view
});
```

### Pre-Commit Hook Setup

**✅ PRE-COMMIT HOOKS ARE CONFIGURED AND ENFORCED**

**Gates are green at baseline and enforced (#118).** Backend coverage is ~92% and frontend coverage clears 85/85/75/85, so `pre-commit run --all-files` passes cleanly. Commit and merge **without** `--no-verify` / `gh pr merge --admin` — `main` branch protection requires the `Frontend Tests` and `Backend Tests` checks (coverage included) to pass before merge. The `--no-verify` escape hatch below is for genuine emergencies only, not routine use.

This project uses automated pre-commit hooks that run before every commit. These hooks enforce TDD and quality standards.

**Install pre-commit hooks (one-time setup):**

```bash
# Install pre-commit (if not already installed)
pip install pre-commit

# Install the git hook scripts
cd /home/frankbria/projects/auto-author
pre-commit install

# Test the hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**What runs on every commit:**

1. **Documentation Auto-Sync** (always runs)
   - Exports current sprint from bd tracker
   - Exports implementation plan from bd tracker
   - Auto-adds updated docs to commit

2. **Frontend Quality Gates** (runs when frontend/ files change)
   - Linting (`npm run lint`)
   - Type checking (`npm run typecheck`)
   - Unit tests (`npm test`)
   - Coverage check (≥85% required)
   - E2E tests (Playwright)

3. **Backend Quality Gates** (runs when backend/ files change)
   - Linting (`ruff check`)
   - Unit tests (`pytest tests/`)
   - Coverage check (≥85% required)

4. **General Code Quality** (always runs)
   - Trailing whitespace removal
   - End-of-file fixing
   - YAML/JSON validation
   - Merge conflict detection
   - Large file detection (>1MB blocked)
   - Private key detection

**Configuration:** See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in project root for full details.

**Bypassing hooks (emergency only):**
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "hotfix: emergency fix"
# Then immediately create follow-up task:
bd create "Add tests for emergency hotfix" -p 0 -t bug
```

### Test Quality Standards

**Tests MUST be:**
- **Isolated**: No dependencies on external services (use mocks)
- **Repeatable**: Same result every time
- **Fast**: Unit tests <1s each, E2E tests <30s each
- **Meaningful**: Test behavior, not implementation
- **Maintainable**: Clear, well-documented test code

**Tests MUST NOT:**
- Use arbitrary timeouts (`await page.waitForTimeout(5000)` ❌)
- Depend on test execution order
- Leave side effects (data, files, processes)
- Test internal implementation details

---

## Deployment Information
- The staging server is located at: https://dev.autoauthor.app (frontend) and https://api.dev.autoauthor.app (backend)
- You can access the staging server with SSH with username root. The keys are local; no password is required.
- There are deployment scripts in the git workflow directories
- **IMPORTANT** there are other aplications on the server. Be aware of port considerations. Right now, the backend uses 8000 and the frontend uses 3002, but be aware that this could change. Check nginx settings for the latest information.
- The applications are managed via PM2 on the server. Since the deployment has a symlinked current release directory, sometimes that needs to be checked if things are out of sync.

## Environment Information

**Package Management**:
- Python: uv for environment and package management
- Node.js: npm for frontend dependencies

**Task Tracking**:
- Use bd (Beads) for all task management
- Run `bd quickstart` to learn the system
- Markdown files (CURRENT_SPRINT.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) are auto-generated snapshots

**Documentation Structure**:
- `CLAUDE.md` (this file) - Quick reference and core guidelines
- `docs/references/*.md` - Detailed reference documentation (read on-demand)
- `claudedocs/*.md` - Technical analysis and detailed plans
- `archive/*.md` - Historical planning documents (read-only)

**Environment Variables**:
- `BYPASS_AUTH=true` - Disable authentication for E2E testing; only takes effect together with `E2E_ALLOW_BYPASS=1` in every environment (frontend middleware #272, backend FastAPI #307 — backend production stays hard-blocked regardless)
- Standard Next.js and FastAPI environment variables (see `.env.example`)

---

## API Overview

### Authentication
- **Production**: Better-auth JWT verification using HS256 shared secret
- **Testing**: `BYPASS_AUTH=true` creates mock authenticated context
- **Security**: Never use auth bypass in production environments

### Core Endpoints
- `/api/v1/books` - Book CRUD operations
- `/api/v1/chapters` - Chapter management
- `/api/v1/toc` - Table of Contents generation
- `/api/v1/export` - PDF/DOCX export

See backend API documentation for full endpoint reference.
