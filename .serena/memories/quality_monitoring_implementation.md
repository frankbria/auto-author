# Quality Monitoring Implementation Context

**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Planning Complete, Ready for Implementation

## Overview
Comprehensive quality monitoring system for Auto-Author application addressing performance tracking, loading states, data preservation, and responsive design validation.

## Current Status

### Completed Work
- ✅ Auto-save optimization with localStorage backup
- ✅ Keyboard navigation WCAG 2.1 compliance
- ✅ Loading state audit (5 high-priority gaps identified)
- ✅ Quality monitoring implementation plan created

### Pending Work (15-17 hours)
- Performance monitoring setup (4h)
- Loading state improvements (3h)
- Data preservation verification (2h)
- Responsive design validation (2h)
- Quality dashboard (2-3h)
- CI/CD integration (2-3h)

## Implementation Plan Location
`/home/frankbria/projects/auto-author/claudedocs/QUALITY_MONITORING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

## Key Technologies
- **Performance**: `web-vitals` npm package
- **Loading States**: React Context + custom hooks
- **Data Storage**: localStorage wrapper with TTL
- **Responsive Testing**: Playwright with viewport helpers
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with quality gates

## Performance Budgets
- LCP: ≤2.5s (good), ≤4s (needs improvement)
- TOC generation: ≤5s (good), ≤10s (needs improvement)
- Export: ≤10s (good), ≤30s (needs improvement)
- Draft generation: ≤8s (good), ≤15s (needs improvement)
- Auto-save: ≤1s (good), ≤5s (needs improvement)

## Implementation Phases
**Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Performance monitoring + loading states
**Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Data preservation + responsive validation
**Phase 3 (Week 3)**: Dashboard + CI/CD integration

## High-Priority Operations Missing Loading States
1. TOC generation (critical)
2. Export operations (critical)
3. Draft generation (critical)
4. Chapter creation (medium)
5. Book metadata save (medium)

## Quality Standards
- Test coverage: ≥85% minimum
- All tests must pass: 100% pass rate
- Responsive: Works on screens ≥320px
- Touch targets: ≥44x44 pixels
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## Git Workflow
- Branch naming: `feat/quality-{component}`
- Commit format: `feat(quality): {description}`
- All changes pushed after each milestone
- Documentation updated synchronously

## Integration Points
- MCP Playwright: Automated responsive testing
- MCP Sequential: Complex test scenario planning
- Serena memory: Cross-session quality metrics
- Context7: Framework-specific patterns

## Next Steps
1. Start Phase 1: Performance monitoring setup
2. Install web-vitals package
3. Create PerformanceTracker utility
4. Integrate with TOC, export, draft operations
5. Update UI_IMPROVEMENTS_TODO.md as tasks complete

## Success Criteria
- All Core Web Vitals in "good" range
- 100% loading state coverage
- Data preservation validated
- Responsive tests passing on all viewports
- Quality dashboard operational
- CI/CD gates enforcing standards
