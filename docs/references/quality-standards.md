# Feature Development Quality Standards

**CRITICAL**: All new features MUST meet the following mandatory requirements before being considered complete.

## Testing Requirements

- **Minimum Coverage**: 85% code coverage ratio required for all new code
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100% - all tests must pass, no exceptions
- **Test Types Required**:
  - Unit tests for all business logic and services
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- **Coverage Validation**: Run coverage reports before marking features complete:
  ```bash
  # Backend
  cd backend && uv run pytest --cov=app tests/ --cov-report=term-missing

  # Frontend
  cd frontend && npm run test:coverage
  ```
- **Test Quality**: Tests must validate behavior, not just achieve coverage metrics
- **Test Documentation**: Complex test scenarios must include comments explaining the test strategy

## Git Workflow Requirements

Before moving to the next feature, ALL changes must be:

1. **Committed with Clear Messages**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(module): descriptive message following conventional commits"
   ```
   - Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, etc.
   - Include scope when applicable: `feat(backend):`, `fix(frontend):`, `test(auth):`
   - Write descriptive messages that explain WHAT changed and WHY

2. **Pushed to Remote Repository**:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
   - Never leave completed features uncommitted
   - Push regularly to maintain backup and enable collaboration
   - Ensure CI/CD pipelines pass before considering feature complete

3. **Branch Hygiene**:
   - Work on feature branches, never directly on `main`
   - Branch naming convention: `feature/<feature-name>`, `fix/<issue-name>`, `docs/<doc-update>`
   - Create pull requests for all significant changes

4. **Backlog Integration**:
   - Create or update tasks in Backlog.md before starting work
   - Move tasks to "in-progress" when beginning implementation
   - Update task status upon completion
   - Reference task IDs in commit messages

## Documentation Requirements

**ALL implementation documentation MUST remain synchronized with the codebase**:

1. **API Documentation**:
   - Update OpenAPI specifications when endpoints change
   - Document all request/response schemas
   - Include example requests and responses
   - Document error responses and status codes

2. **Code Documentation**:
   - Python: Docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
   - TypeScript: JSDoc comments for complex functions and components
   - Update inline comments when implementation changes
   - Remove outdated comments immediately

3. **Implementation Documentation**:
   - Update relevant sections in CLAUDE.md file
   - Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md when scope changes
   - Keep architecture diagrams current
   - Update configuration examples when defaults change
   - Document breaking changes prominently

4. **README Updates**:
   - Keep feature lists current
   - Update setup instructions when dependencies change
   - Maintain accurate command examples
   - Update version compatibility information

5. **Backlog Documentation**:
   - Create architecture decision records for significant changes
   - Document technical choices and trade-offs
   - Update task descriptions with implementation notes
   - Export board status for sprint reviews

## Feature Completion Checklist

Before marking ANY feature as complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests pass (backend and frontend)
- [ ] Code coverage meets 85% minimum threshold
- [ ] Coverage report reviewed for meaningful test quality
- [ ] Code formatted and linted (ruff, ESLint)
- [ ] Type checking passes (mypy for Python, tsc for TypeScript)
- [ ] All changes committed with conventional commit messages
- [ ] All commits pushed to remote repository
- [ ] Backlog task status updated to completed
- [ ] API documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Implementation documentation updated
- [ ] Inline code comments updated or added
- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated (if new patterns introduced)
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Security considerations reviewed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline passes

## Rationale

These standards ensure:
- **Quality**: High test coverage and pass rates prevent regressions
- **Traceability**: Git commits and Backlog integration provide clear history of changes
- **Maintainability**: Current documentation reduces onboarding time and prevents knowledge loss
- **Collaboration**: Pushed changes and task management enable team visibility and code review
- **Reliability**: Consistent quality gates maintain production stability

**Enforcement**: AI agents should automatically apply these standards to all feature development tasks without requiring explicit instruction for each task.
