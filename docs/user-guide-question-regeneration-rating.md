# User Guide: Question Regeneration and Rating Features

## Overview
The question system includes powerful regeneration and rating features that help you get better questions and improve the AI's performance over time. This guide covers how to regenerate questions, rate their quality, and use feedback to enhance your writing experience.

## Question Regeneration

### When to Regenerate Questions

#### Common Scenarios
- **Initial questions don't inspire**: Current questions feel generic or irrelevant
- **Need different focus**: Want questions about specific aspects (character vs. plot)
- **Wrong difficulty level**: Questions are too simple or too complex
- **Genre mismatch**: Questions don't fit your book's genre or style
- **Chapter evolved**: Your chapter direction changed after initial generation

#### Quality Indicators
Look for these signs that regeneration might help:
- Questions repeat similar themes
- Questions feel disconnected from your chapter
- Questions use vague language ("What happens?" vs. "How does Sarah's betrayal affect the team dynamics?")
- Questions don't match your target audience
- Questions lack specific details about your story elements

### How to Regenerate Questions

#### Basic Regeneration
1. **Navigate to Questions Tab**
   - Open your chapter in the editor
   - Click the "Questions" tab

2. **Access Regeneration Options**
   - Click "Regenerate Questions" button
   - Or use keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd + R`

3. **Configure Regeneration Settings**
   ```
   ┌─ Regeneration Options ─────────────────────┐
   │ Count: [10] questions                      │
   │ Difficulty: [Medium ▼]                     │
   │ Focus: [☐ Character ☐ Plot ☑ Setting]    │
   │ [☑] Preserve questions with responses      │
   │ [Generate Questions]                       │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

4. **Review and Accept**
   - Preview the new questions
   - Compare with existing questions
   - Accept or regenerate again

#### Advanced Regeneration Options

## Question Rating System

### Understanding the Rating Scale

#### 5-Star Rating System
- **⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars)**: Excellent - Inspiring, specific, perfectly relevant
- **⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars)**: Good - Helpful, clear, mostly relevant
- **⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars)**: Average - Acceptable, could be improved
- **⭐⭐ (2 stars)**: Poor - Vague, marginally useful
- **⭐ (1 star)**: Bad - Irrelevant, confusing, or generic

#### Rating Criteria
Questions are rated based on:
- **Relevance**: How well it applies to your specific chapter
- **Specificity**: Level of detail and focus
- **Inspiration**: How much it helps generate ideas
- **Clarity**: How easy it is to understand and answer
- **Usefulness**: Overall value for your writing process

### How to Rate Questions

#### Rating Interface
```
Question: "How does the protagonist's internal conflict 
          manifest in this chapter?"

### Effective Rating Feedback

#### What to Include
```
Good Feedback Examples:

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "Perfect! This question made me realize Sarah's 
          fear stems from her childhood trauma."

⭐⭐⭐ "Good direction but too general. Could be more 
        specific about which relationships."

⭐⭐ "This feels like a template question. Doesn't 
      connect to my fantasy setting."

⭐ "Too vague - could apply to any chapter in any book."
```

#### What Makes Good Feedback
- **Specific**: Point out exact issues or strengths
- **Actionable**: Suggest how to improve
- **Context-aware**: Reference your genre, style, or needs
- **Constructive**: Help improve future questions

#### Common Feedback Themes

- **Use middle ratings**: 3 stars for "okay" questions is fine

#### "All questions seem similar in quality"
- **Look for specifics**: Which questions feel more targeted?
- **Consider your writing stage**: Early drafts vs. polishing
- **Think about inspiration**: Which sparked more ideas?
- **Rate relative to your needs**: Some may be better for your style

### Regeneration Problems

#### "New questions aren't much better"
- **Try different focus**: Change question types
- **Adjust difficulty**: Move up or down complexity level
- **Update chapter info**: Ensure title and content are current
- **Rate previous questions**: Help AI learn what doesn't work

#### "I lost good questions during regeneration"
- **Check preserve option**: Ensure "preserve responses" was enabled
- **Review regeneration history**: May be able to recover
- **Export responses first**: Save important work before regenerating
- **Contact support**: May be able to help recover lost questions

#### "Regeneration takes too long"
- **Reduce question count**: Try 5-8 questions instead of 15
- **Simplify parameters**: Use fewer focus types
- **Check system status**: May be temporary server load
- **Try again later**: Peak usage times may be slower

### Best Practices Summary

#### For Rating
