- Quality: Tests passing (verified in isolation)

---

## Blocked Progress: ChapterEditor Tests

### Current Status: 68 Tests Failing ❌

**Failure Pattern**:
```
Error: invariant expected app router to be mounted
  at useRouter (node_modules/next/src/client/components/navigation.ts:128:11)
  at ChapterEditor (src/components/chapters/ChapterEditor.tsx:86:27)
```

**Root Causes**:
1. **Next.js 13+ Router Mocking**: `useRouter()` requires app router context
2. **TipTap Editor Initialization**: `useEditor()` hook not rendering in test environment
3. **Test Environment Gap**: JSDOM doesn't provide full browser APIs needed by TipTap

**Affected Test Files**:
- `ChapterEditor.localStorage.test.tsx` - 34 tests
- `ChapterEditor.saveStatus.test.tsx` - 34 tests
- `ChapterEditor.richText.test.tsx` - Partial failures

**Projected Impact** (if unblocked):
- **+8-10% overall coverage** from ChapterEditor tests
- **+240 passing tests** (68 currently failing + new coverage)
- **Total projected frontend coverage**: 68.78% + 8-10% = **76-79%**

---

## Test Quality Analysis

### Pass Rate Improvement

| Suite | Baseline | Current | Improvement |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Backend | 97.4% | **100%** | **+2.6%** ✅ |
| Frontend | 82.7% | **88.9%** | **+6.2%** ✅ |
| Combined | ~90% | **94.5%** | **+4.5%** ✅ |

### Test Reliability

**Stable Tests**: 565/565 passing tests show zero flakiness
**Blocked Tests**: 68 ChapterEditor tests consistently fail (not flaky)
**New Tests**: 25 new tests (15 wizard + 10 hook) - 100% reliable

---

## Remaining Gaps to 80% Target

### Frontend Coverage Gap Analysis

**Current**: 68.78% statements
**Target**: 80% statements
**Gap**: **-11.22%**

### Path to 80% Coverage

#### Phase 1: Unblock ChapterEditor (Highest Impact)
- **Action**: Fix Next.js router and TipTap mocks
- **Effort**: 2-3 days (medium complexity)
- **Impact**: +8-10% coverage
- **Result**: 68.78% + 9% = **~78%** statements

#### Phase 2: Additional Component Coverage (Bridge Remaining Gap)
- **Targets**:
  - UI components edge cases: +2-3%
  - Hook coverage expansion: +2-3%
  - API error scenarios: +1-2%
- **Effort**: 3-4 days
- **Impact**: +5-8% coverage
- **Result**: 78% + 6% = **~84%** statements ✅ **EXCEEDS TARGET**

### Alternative Path (If ChapterEditor Unblocking Delayed)
1. **UI Components**: Expand to 85% coverage → +4%
2. **Hooks**: Expand to 70% coverage → +5%
3. **Utilities**: Test lib/utils fully → +3%
4. **API Layer**: Network scenarios → +2%
5. **Total**: +14% → **82.78%** ✅ **EXCEEDS TARGET**

**Recommendation**: Prioritize ChapterEditor unblocking (Phase 1) as most efficient path to 80%.

## Comparison to Projections

### Task 5 Baseline Projections vs Actuals

| Improvement Area | Projected | Actual | Status |
|------------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **BookCreationWizard** | +4-6% | +3.5% | ✅ Within range |
| **useChapterTabs Hook** | +3-4% | Included | ✅ Complete |
| **ChapterEditor Unblock** | +8-10% | Blocked | ❌ Deferred |
| **Total Projected** | +15-20% | +3.5% | 🔄 Partial |

### Why Projection Gap Exists

1. **ChapterEditor Blocker**: Expected fix in Iteration 3, actual complexity higher than estimated
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Time spent on E2E test exclusion and Next.js router mocking research
3. **Conservative Execution**: Focused on quality over speed - 100% pass rate for new tests
4. **Realistic Estimate**: +3.5% for 25 new tests aligns with typical coverage gains

### Revised Projection for Iteration 4

**If ChapterEditor unblocked in Iteration 4**:
- ChapterEditor tests: +8-10%
- Additional components: +2-3%
- **Total**: 68.78% + 11% = **~80%** ✅ **REACHES TARGET**

---

### Iteration 3 Infrastructure Work

1. **E2E Test Exclusion** ✅
   - Playwright tests now properly excluded from Jest runs
   - Reduced false test failures from E2E tests being run by Jest

2. **Mock Strategy Refinement** ✅
   - Researched Next.js 13+ router mocking patterns
   - Documented TipTap editor mock requirements
   - Prepared mock strategy for Iteration 4

3. **Test Organization** ✅
   - BookCreationWizard tests: Clean, well-organized
   - useChapterTabs tests: Proper hook testing patterns
   - Test file naming conventions established

4. **Coverage Tooling** ✅
