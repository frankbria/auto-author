## ðŸ”§ Needs Connection

### High Priority
1. **PDF Generation Button** - Backend endpoints exist, frontend button needs onClick handler
   - Location: `/dashboard/books/[bookId]/page.tsx` line 486
   - Backend: `/api/v1/books/{bookId}/export/pdf`
   
2. **Export Page Integration** - Page exists but uses mock data
   - Location: `/dashboard/books/[bookId]/export/page.tsx`
   - Needs: API client methods for export endpoints

3. **Voice Input Production Service** - Currently using browser API
   - AWS Transcribe backend ready
   - Frontend needs service integration

### Medium Priority
1. **Questions/Interview Flow** - Exists but disconnected
   - Location: `/dashboard/books/[bookId]/chapters/page.tsx`
   - Could be integrated as alternative content creation method

2. **Settings Page** - Currently placeholder
3. **Help Documentation** - Currently placeholder

## ðŸš« Missing Features

### UI/UX
1. **Book Deletion** - No UI for deleting books from dashboard
2. **Bulk Operations** - No way to manage multiple books
3. **Search/Filter** - No search functionality for books
4. **Collaboration** - No multi-user features visible

### Technical
1. **Offline Support** - No service workers or offline capability
2. **Version History** - No revision tracking for chapters (only summary has it)
3. **Export Progress** - No real-time progress for long exports
4. **Error Recovery** - Limited error handling UI

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Fixes Needed

### Immediate (< 1 hour each)
1. Connect PDF button to export endpoint
2. Add delete book button to dashboard cards
3. Connect export page to real API
4. Add loading states to more operations

### Short Term (< 4 hours each)
1. Implement settings page basics
2. Add help documentation
3. Improve mobile navigation
4. Add progress indicators for long operations

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations

### For MVP Completion
1. **Connect PDF Export** - Critical for users to get their content out
2. **Fix Export Page** - Replace mock data with API calls
3. **Add Book Deletion** - Basic CRUD functionality
4. **Production Voice Service** - Replace browser API

### For Better UX
1. **Progress Indicators** - For TOC generation, export, etc.
2. **Better Error Messages** - User-friendly error handling
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts Help** - Document available shortcuts
4. **Mobile Polish** - Improve responsive behavior

### For Future Enhancement
1. **Collaborative Editing** - Real-time multi-user support
2. **Advanced Export Options** - EPUB, Markdown, etc.
3. **Version Control** - Git-like branching for books
4. **AI Writing Assistant** - Beyond just draft generation

## Technical Implementation Notes

### API Client Updates Needed
```typescript
// bookClient.ts needs these methods:
- exportPDF(bookId: string, options?: ExportOptions)
- exportDOCX(bookId: string, options?: ExportOptions)
- getExportFormats(bookId: string)
- deleteBook(bookId: string)
```

### Quick PDF Button Fix
```typescript
// In /dashboard/books/[bookId]/page.tsx
const handleGeneratePDF = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await bookClient.exportPDF(bookId);
    // Handle download
  } catch (error) {
    // Show error toast
  }
};
```

The application is well-architected with a clear flow. The main gaps are in connecting existing features rather than building new ones. With a few hours of integration work, the MVP would be fully functional.
