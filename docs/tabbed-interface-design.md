# Tabbed Interface Design Patterns and Component Architecture

## Overview
The chapter tab system in Auto Author is designed for efficient navigation, editing, and management of book chapters. It uses a vertical tabbed interface inspired by modern IDEs, providing a familiar and scalable navigation pattern for books with many chapters.

## Key Design Patterns
- **Vertical Tabs**: Tabs are displayed vertically in a sidebar for better space utilization and readability.
- **Component Composition**: The tab system is composed of modular components: `ChapterTabs`, `TabBar`, `ChapterTab`, and `TabContent`.
- **State Management**: Tab state (active, order, status) is managed via React hooks (`useChapterTabs`) and synchronized with backend and localStorage.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Tabs can be reordered using drag-and-drop, with visual feedback and persistence.
- **Contextual Menus**: Right-click/context menus provide quick access to tab operations (duplicate, delete, reorder).
- **Responsiveness**: The layout adapts to mobile and desktop, with a dropdown for tabs on small screens.

## Component Architecture
- **ChapterTabs**: Main entry point, manages tab state, renders `TabBar` and `TabContent`.
- **TabBar**: Renders the list of tabs, handles drag-and-drop, overflow, and context menus.
- **ChapterTab**: Represents a single tab, displays status, title, and unsaved changes indicator.
- **TabContent**: Loads and displays the content for the active chapter tab.

## Data Flow
- Tab data is loaded from the TOC structure and chapter metadata API.
- User actions (open, close, reorder, edit) update local state and persist to backend/localStorage.
- Tab state is synchronized across browser tabs and sessions.

## Extensibility
- Components are designed for easy extension (e.g., adding new tab actions, custom status indicators, or keyboard shortcuts).
