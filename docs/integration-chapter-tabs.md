# Integration Guide: Connecting Chapter Tabs with Existing Features

## Overview
The chapter tab system is tightly integrated with the book authoring workflow, TOC editor, and chapter content management. This guide explains how tabs connect with other features and how to extend integrations.

## Key Integrations
- **TOC Editor**: Changes in the TOC (add, remove, reorder chapters) are reflected in the tab interface in real time via the `useTocSync` hook and event-based updates.
- **Chapter Editor**: Each tab loads the corresponding chapter editor, sharing state and API methods for content, status, and metadata.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: The active tab and chapter context are reflected in the breadcrumb component for seamless navigation.
- **Tab State Persistence**: Tab state is saved and restored using both localStorage and backend APIs, ensuring continuity across sessions and devices.
- **Status Indicators**: Chapter status (draft, in-progress, completed) is synchronized between the TOC, tabs, and chapter editor.
- **Notifications**: Tab actions (open, close, reorder) can trigger notifications or analytics events for user feedback and tracking.

## Extending Integrations
- Use the `useChapterTabs` and `useTocSync` hooks to connect new features to the tab system.
- Listen for tab state or TOC changes to trigger additional actions (e.g., autosave, analytics, or UI updates).
- Update the tab context menu to add integrations with export, sharing, or AI features.

## Best Practices
- Keep integration logic modular and use hooks for cross-feature communication.
- Test integrations thoroughly to ensure state consistency and user experience.
