# Developer Guide: Extending Chapter Tab Functionality

## Overview
The chapter tab system is modular and designed for easy extension. You can add new features, actions, or integrations by following these guidelines.

## Adding New Tab Actions
- Extend the `TabBar` or `ChapterTab` component to add new actions (e.g., pin, duplicate, export).
- Add new context menu items by updating the context menu component.

## Customizing Tab Status
- Update the status configuration in `ChapterTab.tsx` to add new statuses or icons.
- Sync new statuses with backend chapter metadata.

## Integrating with Other Features
- Use the `useChapterTabs` hook to access and update tab state from other components.
- Listen for tab state changes to trigger autosave, analytics, or notifications.

## Adding Keyboard Shortcuts
- Update the keyboard event handlers in `ChapterTabs.tsx` to add or modify shortcuts.

## Testing Extensions
- Add unit and integration tests for new tab features.
- Test accessibility and keyboard navigation for all new actions.

## Best Practices
- Keep tab logic in dedicated hooks/components for maintainability.
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- Document all new features in the user and developer guides.
