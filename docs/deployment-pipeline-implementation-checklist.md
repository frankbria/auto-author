## Rollback Plan (If Things Go Wrong)

### If New Workflow Causes Issues

1. **Revert workflow changes**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin develop
   ```

2. **Restore original workflows**
   - Restore e2e-staging.yml to block deployments
   - Restore deploy-staging.yml to wait for E2E
   - Push changes

3. **Notify team**
   - Explain what went wrong
   - Estimated time to fix
   - Temporary workflow (manual deployments)

### If Rollback Script Fails

1. **Manual rollback**
   ```bash
   ssh user@dev.autoauthor.app
   cd /opt/auto-author
   PREVIOUS=$(ls -t releases | sed -n '2p')
   ln -sfn releases/$PREVIOUS current
   pm2 restart all
   ```

2. **Verify health**
   ```bash
   curl -f https://api.dev.autoauthor.app/api/v1/health
   curl -f https://dev.autoauthor.app
   ```

3. **Debug rollback script**
   - Check permissions
   - Verify release directory structure
   - Check PM2 process names
   - Test health check URLs

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: E2E tests still blocking deployment

**Symptom**: Deployment waits for E2E tests to complete

**Solution**:
1. Check workflow dependencies in deploy-staging.yml
2. Verify `needs` clause doesn't include e2e-tests job
3. Ensure e2e-staging.yml runs AFTER deploy-staging.yml

### Issue: Notifications not working

**Symptom**: No Slack/Discord alerts on E2E failures

**Solution**:
1. Verify webhook URL in GitHub Secrets
2. Test webhook with curl
3. Check if notification step is running (GitHub Actions logs)
4. Verify channel permissions

### Issue: Rollback script fails

**Symptom**: `rollback.sh` exits with error

**Solution**:
1. Check if previous release exists: `ls -t /opt/auto-author/releases`
2. Verify symlink exists: `ls -l /opt/auto-author/current`
3. Check PM2 processes: `pm2 list`
4. Verify health check URLs are correct

### Issue: Fast tests taking too long

**Symptom**: Fast tests exceed 5 minutes

**Solution**:
1. Check dependency caching (npm, uv)
2. Verify path filtering is working
3. Parallelize frontend + backend jobs
4. Optimize test configuration
