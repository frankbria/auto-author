## Critical Issues

### üî¥ P0: Export Feature Specification Gap
**Expert**: Karl Wiegers (Requirements) + Martin Fowler (Interface Design)

**Issue**: Export functionality has complete backend implementation but incomplete frontend specification and integration.

**Evidence**:
- Backend: `/api/v1/books/{bookId}/export/pdf` endpoint exists and tested
- Frontend: Export button present but no onClick handler
- Export page exists at `/export` but uses mock data
- API client missing export methods

**Impact**:
- Severity: **CRITICAL**
- User Experience: Core feature non-functional
- Business Impact: Users cannot extract their completed work
- Testability: -60% (no acceptance criteria)

**Required Specifications**:

```markdown
## REQUIREMENT EXP-001: Book Export User Flow

### User Story
As an author, I want to export my completed book in multiple formats so that I can publish or share my work.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Export button visible on book detail page in top-right action area
2. Clicking export button opens export options modal
3. Modal displays format selection (PDF, DOCX), page size, chapter selection
4. User confirms export, system shows progress indicator
5. Export completes within 30 seconds for books up to 100 pages
6. Browser automatically downloads file on completion
7. Success notification displays filename and file size
8. Error notification shows specific failure reason with retry option

### Concrete Examples

**Example 1: Successful PDF Export**
```
Given: Book "Dog Training Guide" with 15 completed chapters (80 pages)
When: User clicks "Export" ‚Üí selects PDF, A4, all chapters ‚Üí clicks "Generate"
Then:
  - Progress modal appears: "Generating PDF... estimated 15 seconds"
  - After 12 seconds, download starts automatically
  - Success toast: "Export complete: dog-training-guide.pdf (2.3 MB)"
  - File downloads to user's default download folder
```

**Example 2: Export Timeout**
```
Given: Book with 50 chapters (300 pages)
When: User exports to PDF
Then:
  - After 30 seconds, system shows: "Export is taking longer than expected"
  - Option 1: "Keep waiting" (extends timeout to 60 seconds)
  - Option 2: "Email me when ready" (sends download link via email)
  - Option 3: "Export fewer chapters" (returns to chapter selection)
```

**Example 3: Network Failure During Export**
```
Given: User initiates export
When: Network connection lost during generation
Then:
  - System retries 3 times with exponential backoff
  - After 3 failures: "Export failed. Please check your connection and try again."
  - Retry button available
  - Export request preserved in browser storage for 24 hours
```

### API Contract

```typescript
// bookClient.ts additions needed
interface ExportOptions {
  format: 'pdf' | 'docx';
  includeEmptyChapters: boolean;
  pageSize: 'letter' | 'a4';
  chapters?: string[]; // Optional: specific chapter IDs
}

interface ExportResponse {
  downloadUrl: string;
  filename: string;
  fileSize: number;
  expiresAt: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
}

interface ExportError {
  code: 'TIMEOUT' | 'SIZE_LIMIT' | 'GENERATION_FAILED' | 'NETWORK_ERROR';
  message: string;
  retryable: boolean;
}

async function exportBook(
  bookId: string,
  options: ExportOptions
): Promise<ExportResponse>;
```

### UI Component Specifications

**Export Button Location**: Book detail page, top-right toolbar
**Export Modal**:
- Width: 600px
- Sections: Format selection, Options, Chapter selection, Actions
- Progress indicator: Circular with percentage and estimated time
- Cancel button: Available until generation completes

### Quality Attributes
- Performance: Export completes in <30s for <200 pages
- Usability: Progress updates every 500ms
- Reliability: 3 automatic retries on network failure
- Accessibility: Modal keyboard-navigable, ARIA labels present
```

**Priority**: P0 (Production Blocker)
**Effort**: 16 hours
**Dependencies**: API client update, progress tracking component

---

### üî¥ P0: Error Handling Framework Missing
**Expert**: Michael Nygard (Operations) + Gojko Adzic (Testability)

**Issue**: No unified specification for error handling, retry logic, or user notification patterns.

**Evidence**:
- BookCreationWizard: Generic "Failed to create book" message
- ChapterTabs: Generic "Failed to delete chapter" message
- No retry mechanism specified
- No distinction between transient and permanent errors

**Impact**:
- Severity: **HIGH**
- Production Stability: Users will see cryptic errors
- Support Burden: HIGH (no clear error messages)
- Recovery: Users don't know if they should retry

**Required Specifications**:

```markdown
## REQUIREMENT ERR-001: Unified Error Handling Framework

### Error Classification

**Transient Errors** (User should retry):
- Network timeout
- Server temporarily unavailable (503)
- Rate limit exceeded (429)

**Permanent Errors** (User should fix input):
- Validation failure (400)
- Resource not found (404)
- Unauthorized (401)

**System Errors** (Technical issue):
- Server error (500)
- Unexpected API response
- Client-side JavaScript error

### User Notification Patterns

#### Transient Errors
```typescript
// Display with retry button
{
  title: "Connection Issue",
  message: "Unable to save chapter. Retrying automatically...",
  type: "warning",
  action: {
    label: "Retry Now",
    onClick: retryFunction
  },
  autoRetry: true,
  attempts: "2 of 3"
}
```

#### Permanent Errors
```typescript
// Display with correction guidance
{
  title: "Validation Error",
  message: "Book title must be between 1 and 200 characters",
  type: "error",
  field: "title", // Highlights the problematic field
  suggestion: "Please enter a valid title"
}
```

#### System Errors
```typescript
// Display with support reference
{
  title: "Something Went Wrong",
  message: "An unexpected error occurred. Our team has been notified.",
  type: "error",
  reference: "ERR-20251011-A5F2D",
  action: {
    label: "Contact Support",
    onClick: () => openSupportChat()
  }
}
```

### Retry Logic Specification

**Automatic Retry**: For all transient errors
- Attempt 1: Immediate
- Attempt 2: Wait 2 seconds
- Attempt 3: Wait 4 seconds
- After 3 failures: Display error with manual retry option

**Manual Retry**: User-initiated
- Retry button available for all retryable errors
- Preserves user input during retry
- Shows retry attempt count

**No Retry**: For permanent errors
- Display error immediately
- Provide correction guidance
- Highlight problematic fields

### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Unified error handler
async function handleApiCall<T>(
  apiFunction: () => Promise<T>,
  options: {
    maxRetries?: number;
    retryDelay?: number;
    onError?: (error: ApiError) => void;
  }
): Promise<T> {
  const { maxRetries = 3, retryDelay = 2000 } = options;

  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await apiFunction();
    } catch (error) {
      if (!isRetryable(error) || attempt === maxRetries) {
        showErrorNotification(error, attempt);
        throw error;
      }
      await delay(retryDelay * attempt);
    }
  }
}
```

### Examples

**Example 1: Network Timeout During Chapter Save**
```
Given: User editing chapter content
When: Auto-save triggers but network timeout occurs
Then:
  - Toast appears: "Connection issue. Retrying... (1 of 3)"
  - System retries after 2 seconds
  - If retry succeeds: Toast updates to "Chapter saved"
  - If all retries fail: Toast shows "Unable to save. Retry?" with retry button
  - Content preserved in localStorage
```

**Example 2: Validation Error on Book Creation**
```
Given: User creates book with empty title
When: User clicks "Create Book"
Then:
  - Title field highlighted in red
  - Error message below field: "Title is required (1-200 characters)"
  - Form submit disabled until error corrected
  - No retry option (user must fix input)
```
```

**Priority**: P0 (Production Blocker)
**Effort**: 20 hours
**Dependencies**: Error boundary component, toast notification system

---

### üî¥ P0: API Contract Formalization
**Expert**: Martin Fowler (Interface Design)

**Issue**: Missing TypeScript interfaces and formal contracts between frontend and backend.

**Evidence**:
- No formal API response type definitions
- Error responses inconsistent
- Export endpoints not integrated
- API versioning strategy undefined

**Impact**:
- Severity: **MEDIUM-HIGH**
- Maintainability: -50% (integration bugs likely)
- API Evolution: Difficult without contracts
- Type Safety: Limited compile-time guarantees

**Required Specifications**:

```typescript
// API Contract Specification - bookClient.ts

// ============================================================================
// Base Types
// ============================================================================

interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  meta?: {

}

// ============================================================================
// API Client Methods (MISSING - NEEDS ADDITION)
// ============================================================================

class BookClient {
  // ... existing methods ...

  /**
   * Export book in specified format
   * @throws {ApiError} If export fails or times out
   */
  async exportBook(
    bookId: string,
    options: ExportOptions
  ): Promise<ExportResponse> {
    // Implementation
  }

  /**
   * Delete book and all associated chapters
   * @throws {ApiError} If deletion fails
   */
  async deleteBook(bookId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Implementation
  }

  /**
   * Get export status for long-running exports
   */
  async getExportStatus(
    bookId: string,
    exportId: string
  ): Promise<ExportStatus> {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

**Priority**: P0 (Production Blocker)
**Effort**: 12 hours
**Dependencies**: Backend OpenAPI spec alignment

## High Priority Issues

### üü° P1: Book Deletion UI Missing
**Expert**: Karl Wiegers (Requirements Completeness)

**Issue**: CRUD operations incomplete - no user-facing book deletion capability.

**Current State**: Backend DELETE `/api/v1/books/{bookId}` exists, no UI

**Required Specifications**:

```markdown
## REQUIREMENT BK-DEL-001: Book Deletion

### User Story
As an author, I want to delete books I no longer need so that I can keep my dashboard organized.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Delete button available on book card (dashboard) and book detail page
2. Clicking delete shows confirmation modal with data loss warning
3. Modal lists: book title, chapter count, total word count
4. User must type book title to confirm deletion (prevent accidental delete)
5. Deletion removes book and all chapters immediately
6. Success notification: "Book deleted: [title]"
7. User redirected to dashboard after deletion from book detail page

### Concrete Example
```
Given: Book "Draft Project" with 5 chapters (2,000 words)
When: User clicks delete icon on book card
Then:
  - Modal appears: "Delete Book?"
  - Warning: "This will permanently delete 'Draft Project' and its 5 chapters (2,000 words). This action cannot be undone."
  - Input field: "Type 'Draft Project' to confirm"
  - Delete button disabled until exact title entered
  - After confirmation: Book removed from dashboard
  - Toast: "Book deleted: Draft Project"
```

### UI Placement
- **Dashboard**: Three-dot menu on book card ‚Üí "Delete" option (red text)
- **Book Detail Page**: Toolbar ‚Üí "Actions" dropdown ‚Üí "Delete Book" (red text)

### Safety Measures
- Require exact title match for confirmation
- Soft delete (retain in database for 30 days before permanent deletion)
- Add "Restore" option in settings for recently deleted books
```

**Priority**: P1 (High - Complete CRUD)
**Effort**: 8 hours
**Dependencies**: Confirmation modal component, soft delete backend

### üü° P1: Specification by Example for Critical Flows
**Expert**: Gojko Adzic (Specification by Example)

**Issue**: Abstract flow descriptions without concrete examples lead to implementation ambiguity.

**Required Additions**:

```markdown
## Specification by Example: TOC Generation Flow

### Scenario 1: Successful TOC Generation
```
Given: User has written summary "A comprehensive guide to sustainable gardening for beginners, covering soil preparation, plant selection, watering techniques, pest management, and seasonal planning."

When: User clicks "Generate Table of Contents"

Then: System analyzes summary
  - Readiness score: 85% (sufficient)
  - No clarifying questions needed
  - Proceeds directly to generation

And: System generates TOC structure:
  Chapter 1: Introduction to Sustainable Gardening
    1.1: Why Sustainable Gardening Matters
    1.2: Benefits for You and the Environment
    1.3: What You'll Learn in This Guide

  Chapter 2: Preparing Your Garden
    2.1: Understanding Your Soil
    2.2: Composting Basics
    2.3: Raised Beds vs In-Ground Gardens

  Chapter 3: Choosing the Right Plants
    3.1: Native Plants for Your Region
    3.2: Companion Planting Strategies
    3.3: Drought-Resistant Varieties

  ... (continues for 8 total chapters)

And: User can:
  - Edit chapter titles inline
  - Add/remove chapters
  - Drag-and-drop to reorder
  - Add subchapters by clicking "+"
  - Save and proceed to chapter writing
```

### Scenario 2: Insufficient Summary - Clarifying Questions
```
Given: User writes minimal summary "Book about dogs"

When: User clicks "Generate Table of Contents"

Then: System analyzes summary
  - Readiness score: 35% (insufficient)
  - System generates 5 clarifying questions:
    1. "What age range of dogs are you targeting? (puppies, adult dogs, senior dogs, or all ages?)"
    2. "What aspect of dog care is your focus? (training, health, behavior, breeding, or general care?)"
    3. "Who is your target audience? (first-time owners, experienced owners, professionals?)"
    4. "What is the desired depth? (beginner guide, comprehensive manual, quick reference?)"
    5. "Any specific breeds or general information?"

When: User answers questions:
  1. "First-time puppy owners"
  2. "Basic training and behavior"
  3. "Complete beginners with no dog experience"
  4. "Step-by-step beginner guide"
  5. "All breeds, general advice"

Then: System regenerates TOC with:
  - 12 chapters focused on puppy training
  - Beginner-friendly language
  - Step-by-step structure
  - Practical examples for all breeds
```

### Scenario 3: Generation Timeout
```
Given: User with slow connection clicks "Generate TOC"

When: 10 seconds pass with no response

Then:
  - Progress indicator shows "Still working... analyzing your summary"
  - After 15 seconds: "Taking longer than expected. This sometimes happens with complex summaries."
  - After 20 seconds: Options presented:
    1. "Keep waiting"
    2. "Try with a shorter summary"
    3. "Contact support"

  - If user waits and generation completes after 25 seconds:
    - Success notification: "TOC generated successfully"
    - Generated TOC displays normally
```

## Specification by Example: Voice Input

### Scenario 1: Successful Voice Input
```
Given: User is on summary input page with empty textarea
  And: User's browser supports Web Speech API
  And: User has granted microphone permission

When: User clicks microphone button

Then:
  - Microphone button changes to red pulsing animation
  - Status text appears: "Listening..."
  - Browser prompts for microphone permission (first time only)

When: User speaks "This book is about sustainable gardening for beginners covering soil preparation plant selection and seasonal planning"

Then:
  - Text appears in textarea as user speaks (real-time)
  - Word count updates: "14 words (minimum 30 for TOC generation)"
  - After 3 seconds of silence, recording stops automatically
  - Microphone button returns to normal state
  - Status text: "Voice input complete"
```

### Scenario 2: Browser Not Supported
```
Given: User on Safari iOS 14 (no Web Speech API support)

When: Page loads

Then:
  - Microphone button is grayed out
  - Tooltip on hover: "Voice input not supported in this browser"
  - Help link: "Supported browsers: Chrome, Edge, Safari 15+"
```

### Scenario 3: Permission Denied
```
Given: User clicks microphone button
  And: Browser prompts for permission

When: User denies microphone permission

Then:
  - Error toast appears: "Microphone access required for voice input"
  - Button returns to normal state
  - Help text: "Enable microphone in browser settings to use voice input"
  - Link to browser-specific permission instructions
```
```
