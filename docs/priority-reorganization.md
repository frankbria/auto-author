# Priority Reorganization - October 15, 2025

## Overview

This document explains the priority reorganization implemented to better align with MVP (Minimum Viable Product) principles, moving away from comprehensive accessibility auditing as P0 priority.

## Changes Made

### Before (Accessibility-First)
- **P0**: Accessibility Audit (Phases 1-5) 
- **P1**: Operational Requirements
- **P2**: Settings, Help Pages, Mobile Experience
- **P3**: Advanced features

### After (MVP-First)
- **P0**: Core MVP functionality + Critical operational requirements
- **P1**: Essential operational requirements + Basic user experience
- **P2**: Comprehensive accessibility audit + Enhanced mobile experience  
- **P3**: Advanced features

## Specific Priority Changes

### Moved from P0 to P2 (Accessibility Auditing)
- `auto-author-1`: Accessibility Audit - Phase 1: Automated scanning
- `auto-author-2`: Accessibility Audit - Phase 2: Manual keyboard testing  
- `auto-author-3`: Accessibility Audit - Phase 3: Screen reader testing
- `auto-author-4`: Accessibility Audit - Phase 4: Visual testing
- `auto-author-5`: Accessibility Audit - Phase 5: Documentation & reporting

**Rationale**: While accessibility is important, comprehensive auditing should come after proving core MVP functionality works. Basic accessibility practices are already implemented.

### Elevated from P1 to P0 (Critical for MVP)
- `auto-author-7`: Error logging and monitoring  
- `auto-author-8`: Session management

**Rationale**: Error monitoring is essential to know when MVP breaks in production. Session management is critical for basic user authentication and persistence.

### Elevated from P2 to P1 (Basic UX)
- `auto-author-13`: Touch target sizing verification (already implemented)
- `auto-author-17`: Help documentation

**Rationale**: Basic mobile usability (touch targets) and help documentation are essential for MVP user experience.

## Current Priority Structure

### P0 - MVP Core (Must Have)
- Fix frontend tests (in progress)
- Error logging and monitoring
- Session management

### P1 - MVP Foundation (Should Have) 
- Test coverage measurement
- E2E test verification
- Help documentation
- Touch target sizing verification
- Other operational requirements (SLA monitoring, backups, user tracking)

### P2 - Enhanced Experience (Nice to Have)
- Complete accessibility audit (all 5 phases)
- Enhanced mobile features
- Settings and onboarding pages
- Mobile performance optimization

### P3 - Advanced Features (Future)
- AI features
- Collaboration tools
- Native mobile apps
- Advanced export formats

## Impact on Sprint Goal

**Previous**: "Production readiness - Quality, contracts, accessibility"
**Updated**: "MVP production readiness - Core functionality, monitoring, and basic usability"

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Focus on Core Value**: Prioritizes functionality that proves product-market fit
2. **Operational Readiness**: Ensures MVP can be monitored and maintained in production  
3. **User Experience**: Maintains basic usability without over-engineering
4. **Accessibility Foundation**: Preserves existing accessibility implementations while deferring comprehensive auditing
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Prevents blocking MVP launch on comprehensive but non-critical auditing

## Note on Accessibility

This reorganization does NOT mean accessibility is unimportant. The codebase already has:
- ✅ Touch targets: 100% WCAG 2.1 Level AAA compliance (44x44px minimum)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation: WCAG 2.1 compliant
- ✅ Loading states: Comprehensive screen reader support
- ✅ Accessibility preparation: Tools installed, guidelines documented

The comprehensive 5-phase audit is simply deferred to P2 to focus on MVP core functionality first.
