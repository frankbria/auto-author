# 4-Week Go-Live Task Plan
**Generated**: 2025-10-18
**Target Go-Live**: November 15, 2025
**Total Estimated Hours**: 173h (~43h/week)

## Executive Summary

This task plan derives from the comprehensive 4-week go-live analysis and translates findings into actionable tasks tracked in bd (Beads). The plan follows a critical path: **Week 1 must achieve 100% test pass rate** to enable subsequent weeks' work.

### Current State
- **Backend**: 100% service test pass (108/108), API tests hanging
- **Frontend**: 87.8% test pass (607/691), 81 failing, 3 skipped
- **Production Readiness**: Backend 70%, Infrastructure 20%, Compliance 0%
- **Sprint Progress**: 78.1% complete (Sprint 3-4, Week 6)

### Confidence Assessment
- **Go-Live Feasibility**: 70% (MODERATE)
- **Critical Risk**: Week 1 test resolution (if not 100% resolved → 45% confidence)
- **Success Factor**: Parallel execution of Week 2-4 tasks after Week 1 completion

---

## Week 1: Test Suite Resolution (24h)
**Goal**: Achieve 100% test pass rate across backend and frontend
**Status**: CRITICAL PATH - All subsequent work depends on this

### Backend Tasks (10h)

#### bd-3 [P0] Investigate and fix backend API test hanging (8h)
**Description**: API tests hang after initial execution despite 100% service test pass rate

**Root Cause Investigation**:
1. MongoDB connection timeout in test environment
2. TestClient async configuration issues
3. Potential fixture cleanup problems

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Review MongoDB connection handling in `conftest.py`
- [ ] Check TestClient async context manager usage
- [ ] Verify fixture cleanup and database isolation
- [ ] Add timeout logging to identify hanging tests
- [ ] Run individual API test files to isolate issue

**Success Criteria**:
- All API tests execute without hanging
- 100% pass rate maintained (currently 108/108 service tests pass)
- Test execution time < 5 minutes for full suite

**Dependencies**: None
**Blocks**: bd-7 (coverage measurement)

#### Additional Backend Validation (2h)
- [ ] Verify `.env.test` configuration completeness

---

### Frontend Tasks (14h)

#### bd-2 [P0] Fix frontend test failures - Add ResizeObserver and scrollIntoView mocks (6h)
**Description**: 81 failing tests due to missing browser API mocks

**Root Cause**: Radix UI components require `ResizeObserver` and `scrollIntoView` which are not available in Jest/jsdom environment

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// frontend/jest.setup.ts
global.ResizeObserver = jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
  observe: jest.fn(),
  unobserve: jest.fn(),
  disconnect: jest.fn(),
}));

Element.prototype.scrollIntoView = jest.fn();
```

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Add ResizeObserver mock to `jest.setup.ts`

- [ ] Run test suite to verify fixes
- [ ] Document mock requirements in testing infrastructure docs

**Success Criteria**:
- ResizeObserver errors eliminated

**Dependencies**: None
**Blocks**: bd-4, bd-5, bd-7

#### bd-4 [P1] Fix VoiceTextInput test timeouts (4h)
**Description**: VoiceTextInputIntegration tests exceed 5000ms timeout

**Root Cause**: Async operations in voice input component not properly handled in tests

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Review VoiceTextInput component async patterns
- [ ] Increase Jest timeout for voice tests to 10000ms

- No flaky test behavior
- Test reliability >99%

**Dependencies**: bd-2
**Blocks**: bd-7

- [ ] Fix component logic or test assertions as needed
- [ ] Verify end-to-end flow in UI manually

**Success Criteria**:
- All ChapterQuestionsEndToEnd assertions pass

## Risk Mitigation

### Critical Risks

1. **Week 1 Test Failures** (Probability: 40%, Impact: CRITICAL)
   - **Mitigation**: Allocate additional developer time, consider extending Week 1 to 10 days if needed
   - **Fallback**: Push go-live date to November 22, 2025

2. **Accessibility Compliance** (Probability: 30%, Impact: HIGH)
   - **Mitigation**: Engage accessibility consultant if needed, use automated tools extensively
   - **Fallback**: Launch with known accessibility issues documented, plan remediation sprint

3. **Infrastructure Setup Delays** (Probability: 25%, Impact: MEDIUM)
   - **Mitigation**: Use managed services (AWS, Vercel) instead of self-hosted if time-critical
   - **Fallback**: Launch on staging environment temporarily, migrate to production post-launch

4. **Performance Issues Under Load** (Probability: 20%, Impact: MEDIUM)
   - **Mitigation**: Implement CDN early, optimize database queries proactively
   - **Fallback**: Limit concurrent users initially, scale infrastructure reactively
