# Coding Session - Comprehensive Production Readiness Review

**Date**: 2025-12-02
**Branch**: main
**Last Commit**: e2f3c55 (fix(deploy): Fix PM2 ecosystem config and restore deployment reliability)

---

## Session Goals

Conduct comprehensive codebase review against project specifications to:
1. Identify current implementation status across all subsystems
2. Document gaps between current state and production requirements
3. Analyze test coverage and identify testing gaps
4. Review security, performance, and deployment readiness
5. Synchronize beads issue tracker with actual codebase state
6. Generate final production roadmap to launch

---

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Parallel Expert Analysis ✓
Spawn 10 specialized agents to review every subsystem:
- fastapi-expert → Backend API architecture
- python-expert → Service layer & business logic
- mongodb-expert → Database schema & operations
- react-expert → Frontend component architecture
- nextjs-expert → Next.js routing & SSR patterns
- security-engineer → Security audit & OWASP compliance
- quality-engineer → Test coverage & CI/CD analysis
- gitops-ci-specialist → Deployment pipeline review
- technical-writer → Documentation completeness audit
- system-architect → Architecture alignment validation

**Output**: 10 analysis reports in `/docs/analysis/`

### Phase 2: Gap Synthesis
- requirements-analyst consolidates all findings
- Produces unified gap inventory at `/docs/production-readiness-gaps.md`

### Phase 3: Beads Synchronization
- Sync beads database with identified gaps
- Close completed issues, create new ones for gaps
- Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and CURRENT_SPRINT.md

### Phase 4: Production Roadmap
- product-manager-advisor creates phased launch plan
- Produces `/docs/PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`

## Current Project State

**Statistics**:
- Total Issues: 75 (37 open, 37 closed, 8 blocked)
- Ready Tasks: 29 (no blockers)
- Backend Coverage: ~60% (target: 85%)
- Frontend Test Pass Rate: 99.3% (732/735 tests)
- E2E Test Coverage: 85%+

**Critical Blockers (P0)**:
1. auto-author-twk: Backend Pydantic schema error (crash loop)
2. auto-author-qou: bookClient.test.tsx trailing slash mismatch

## Notes

- Execution on main branch (documentation-only changes)
- Estimated token usage: ~110k-175k (within 200k budget)
- Estimated execution time: 40-60 minutes total
- All agents run in parallel for Phase 1 efficiency
