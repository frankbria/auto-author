## 🔐 Authentication with Clerk

Auto Author uses Clerk for authentication, providing:

- Secure user registration and login
- Social login options (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Multi-factor authentication
- Email verification
- Session management across devices
- Password reset functionality

While Clerk manages authentication, we maintain a local user table in our MongoDB database that maps Clerk user IDs to our application's user entities. This approach allows us to:

1. Associate user-generated content (books, chapters, etc.) with specific users
2. Store application-specific user preferences and metadata
3. Implement role-based permissions within our application
4. Maintain data relationships without exposing authentication details

The architecture separates authentication concerns (handled by Clerk) from application data management (handled by our backend), creating a more secure and maintainable system.

### Authentication Implementation Details

**Production Environment:**
- JWT verification using Clerk's JWKS endpoint (`https://clerk.{domain}/.well-known/jwks.json`)
- Secure token validation with automatic key rotation support
- Session management with configurable timeout policies

**Development & Testing:**
- Auth bypass mode available via `BYPASS_AUTH=true` environment variable
- Enables E2E testing without real authentication credentials
- **Security Note:** Auth bypass must NEVER be enabled in production

## 📚 Table of Contents Generation

Auto Author uses AI to generate structured table of contents from book summaries:

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Convert summaries into comprehensive chapter structures
- **Interactive Wizard**: Step-by-step guidance through the TOC creation process
- **Clarifying Questions**: Targeted questions to improve TOC quality
- **Visual Editing**: Intuitive interface for refining the generated structure
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Support for chapters and nested subchapters

For detailed documentation about TOC generation:

- [TOC Generation User Guide](docs/user-guide-toc-generation.md)
- [API TOC Endpoints](docs/api-toc-endpoints.md)
