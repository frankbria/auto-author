# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment

## Project Overview
This project uses the SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology for systematic Test-Driven Development with AI assistance through Claude-Flow orchestration.
This is a monorepo for the auto-author project with a Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend.
## Project Structure

-    `frontend/` - Next.js application
-    `backend/` - FastAPI Python application
-    `docs/` - Project documentation

## Development Commands
### Backend (FastAPI)

  -  Setup: `cd backend && uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate && uv sync`
  -  Start server: `cd backend && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000`
  -  Run tests: `cd backend && uv run pytest`
  -  Quick validation: `cd backend && uv run python quick_validate.py`
  -  Lint/Format: `cd backend && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .`

### Frontend (Next.js)

- `./claude-flow sparc tdd "<feature>"`: Run complete TDD workflow using SPARC methodology
- `./claude-flow sparc info <mode>`: Get detailed information about a specific mode

### Standard Build Commands for the Frontend, /frontend
- `npm run build`: Build the project
- `npm run test`: Run the test suite
- `npm run lint`: Run linter and format checks
- `npm run typecheck`: Run TypeScript type checking

### Standard Build Commands for the Backend, /backend

## SPARC Methodology Workflow

### 1. Specification Phase
```bash
# Create detailed specifications and requirements
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Define user authentication requirements"
```
- Define clear functional requirements
- Document edge cases and constraints
- Create user stories and acceptance criteria
- Establish non-functional requirements

### 2. Pseudocode Phase
```bash
# Develop algorithmic logic and data flows
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "Create authentication flow pseudocode"
```
- Break down complex logic into steps
- Define data structures and interfaces
- Plan error handling and edge cases
- Create modular, testable components

### 3. Architecture Phase
```bash
# Design system architecture and component structure
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Design authentication service architecture"
```
- Create system diagrams and component relationships
- Define API contracts and interfaces
- Plan database schemas and data flows
- Establish security and scalability patterns

### 4. Refinement Phase (TDD Implementation)
```bash
# Execute Test-Driven Development cycle
./claude-flow sparc tdd "implement user authentication system"
```

**TDD Cycle:**
1. **Red**: Write failing tests first
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Optimize and clean up code
4. **Repeat**: Continue until feature is complete

### 5. Completion Phase
```bash
# Integration, documentation, and validation
./claude-flow sparc run integration "integrate authentication with user management"
```
- Integrate all components
- Perform end-to-end testing
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Validate against original requirements

## Code Style and Best Practices

### SPARC Development Principles
- **Modular Design**: Keep files under 500 lines, break into logical components
- **Environment Safety**: Never hardcode secrets or environment-specific values
- **Test-First**: Always write tests before implementation (Red-Green-Refactor)
- **Clean Architecture**: Separate concerns, use dependency injection
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation

### Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety and better tooling
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes)
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Prefer composition over inheritance

### Memory and State Management
- Use claude-flow memory system for persistent state across sessions
- Store progress and findings using namespaced keys
- Query previous work before starting new tasks
- Export/import memory for backup and sharing

## SPARC Memory Integration

### Memory Commands for SPARC Development
```bash
# Store project specifications
./claude-flow memory store spec_auth "User authentication requirements and constraints"

# Store architectural decisions
./claude-flow memory store arch_decisions "Database schema and API design choices"

# Store test results and coverage
./claude-flow memory store test_coverage "Authentication module: 95% coverage, all tests passing"

# Query previous work
./claude-flow memory query auth_implementation

# Export project memory
./claude-flow memory export project_backup.json
```

### Memory Namespaces
- **`spec`**: Requirements and specifications
- **`arch`**: Architecture and design decisions
- **`impl`**: Implementation notes and code patterns
- **`test`**: Test results and coverage reports
- **`debug`**: Bug reports and resolution notes

## Workflow Examples

### Feature Development Workflow
```bash
# 1. Start with specification
./claude-flow sparc run spec-pseudocode "User profile management feature"

# 2. Design architecture
./claude-flow sparc run architect "Profile service architecture with data validation"

# 3. Implement with TDD

# 1. Debug and analyze
./claude-flow sparc run debug "authentication token expiration issue"

# 2. Write regression tests
./claude-flow sparc run tdd "token refresh mechanism tests"

# 3. Implement fix

## Troubleshooting

### Common SPARC Issues
- **Mode not found**: Check `.roomodes` file exists and is valid JSON
- **Memory persistence**: Ensure `memory/` directory has write permissions
- **Tool access**: Verify required tools are available for the selected mode
- **Namespace conflicts**: Use unique memory namespaces for different features

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check SPARC configuration
./claude-flow sparc modes
